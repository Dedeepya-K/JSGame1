# JSGame1: Rock Paper Scissors
The series of repositories, JSGames are simply an activity I tried to enroll myself into- Learning Javascript by creating simple games, that'll help me understand the methods and properties in JS better.

Game 1: Rock Paper Scissors

The aim of this game is to help us familiarize with the following methods and properties.
* .getElementById
*  .querySelectorAll
*  .forEach()
*  .addEventListener()
*  .innerHTML
*  e.target.id
*  Math.floor()
*  Math.random()


### Some random takeaways:
> dir in the HTML statement __<html lang="en" dir="ltr">__ simply specifies teh direction of text direction, ltr means left to right.
  
> async defer in  __<script src="" async defer></script>__ tells the browser not to wait for the scripts to load but simply process the HTML available.
  The defer attribute tells the browser not to wait for the script. Instead, the browser will continue to process the HTML, build DOM. The script loads “in the     background”, and then runs when the DOM is fully built.
  
> span id is used in the HTML since later we are gonna pick that out to use in our js program
